		<h2>"Overview"</h2>
		<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Midwifery practice in the Philippines has been recognized as one of the primary healthcare
		services for the people. The role of midwives has been expanded to address the basic health service needs of mothers
		and their children, and ensure patient safety. Midwifery education must be able to respond to those needs by 
		producing midwives who have relevant knowledge and skills and appropriate attitude necessary to deliver quality 
		care with competency and dedication.</p>
		<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;UEP is committed in total formation of professional midwives, in meeting the changing and challenging
		demands of healthcare provisions; in living a life of virtue, excellence and service because the institution
		believes that Midwifery is a distinct profession with a specific scope of practice, roles and regulations, and
		a legislation which aims to promote, maintain, and restore health while providing a distinctive type of care that
		benefits women, newborns and their families.</p>
		<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In addition, Our Diploma in Midwifery is a two-year program consisting of general education 
		and professional courses which prepare students for entry-level midwifery competencies. This direct entry program
		includes Clinical Practicum in Foundations of Midwifery, Normal Obstetrics and Care of the Newborn, Introduction
		to High Risk Obstetrics, Basic Care of Infants and Feeding, Basic Family Planning, Primary Health Care and Midwifery
		Ethics, Law and Practice. Graduates of the program are qualified to take the government licensure examination.
