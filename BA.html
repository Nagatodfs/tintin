		<h2>"Overview"</h2>
		<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;As the economy continues to change, so is the need for people who can easily adapt to these changes 
		and effectively lead an organization where they work. A course in business administration provides students
		with a goal-focused curriculum and training required to excel in the fields of business, industry and government. 
		Most business administration degrees teaches students to be critical thinkers and innovative leaders by 
		placing special emphasis on core areas like finance, marketing, economics, accounting, statistics, problem 
		solving, human resources and decision-making. A career in Business Administration demands an enterprising
		attitude and the ability to thrive in stressful situations, collaborate with others and effectively delegate
		with authority.</p>
		<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Business administration includes a great deal of problem solving and number crunching, so proficiency in
		math is always an asset. The University of Eastern Pangasinan offers Bachelor Degree in Business with a general 
		knowledge base and students may specialize in a particular area of their choice. These programs introduce 
		students to a wide range of principles ranging from politics, ethics, sensitivity, innovativeness, creativity 
		and other dynamics enabling them to acquire a deeper appreciation of their interrelationships and their individual
		impact to an organization. Students may decide which areas of specialization to pursue based on their strengths and
		interest.</p>
		<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;At the end of the day, the main point of a Business Administration course is not just to produce an efficient
		business person, but an effective one as well.<br> In UEP, the BSBA is offered with a business administration
		major and concentrations in both Financial Management and Marketing Management
