		<br><br><br>
		<h1> History</h1>
		<p> The University of Eastern Pangasinan is the first institution of higher education 
		in the town of Binalonan and the second one in Pangasinan to adopt a public-private partnership 
		wherein the government assumes substantial financial grants and private entities take on the operations 
		of the university. The establishment of UEP began in 2005 following a dissertation paper authored
		by its founding president, Dr. Ramon V. Guico III, structured around the idea of creating a world-class 
		institution that will provide the best practices in education to students regardless of their social, 
		cultural and financial background.</p><br>
		
		<p>From its modest beginnings in an obscure building located in the old public market, 
		UEP has emerged into a modern architectural display along MacArthur Highway in barangay Canarvacanan
		set against Binalonan’s pastoral backdrop. The first of three towers was inaugurated in July 2012 and 
		houses the university’s academic departments including Criminology, Hospitality and Management, Business 
		Administration, Elementary and Secondary Education, Midwifery and Information Technology. The building, which
		can accommodate 3,000 students, is also occupied by 36 classrooms, the administrative office, a library and demo
		laboratories where course-related activities and practical applications are conducted.</p><br>

		<p> Envisioned to be a center of learning in Pangasinan, the campus community promotes diversity
		among its students and ensures that each one is given the opportunity to explore his interests, 
		take part in extracurricular activities, nurture relationships and achieve personal growth. UEP also 
		distinguishes itself for creating a culture of learning through a well-designed campus that integrates
		modern conveniences with the natural beauty of its surroundings. Aside from the main building, a garden
		plaza and food court are already in the final stages of completion. Once the master plan has been fully
		implemented, UEP will have various facilities for learning and recreation including more classrooms,
		a gymnasium, basketball court and tennis court. </p><br>
		
		<p>In 2011, UEP presented its first batch of graduates with degrees in BS Information Technology (6), 
		BS Business Administration (3), BS Hospitality and Management (1) and diplomas in Midwifery (6). In the 
		succeeding year, the University has more than doubled its graduates and continues to attract enrollees from 
		Binalonan and neighboring towns in Pangasinan with its affordable but quality education and a faculty who 
		are all experts in their respective fields.</p><br>
